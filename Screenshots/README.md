## Inference from Simulation Screenshot
The simulation output waveform shows the CORDIC module’s cosine and sine computations for different input angles.
As the start signal is asserted, the module processes each angle, and after completing all iterations, the done signal goes high, indicating valid results. The outputs cos_out and sin_out (in Q2.14 fixed-point format) match the expected trigonometric values for angles like 0°, 30°, 45°, and 60°, confirming that the CORDIC algorithm accurately computes sine and cosine using shift-and-add operations without multipliers. This verifies that the design successfully performs iterative vector rotations to compute sine and cosine with minimal error, making it suitable for FPGA-based digital signal processing applications. 
To optimize algorithm i.e to decrease the value of error number of iterations should be increased (n).
